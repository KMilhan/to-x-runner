# Real-World Concurrency Examples for `unirun`

This catalog highlights concrete workloads that benefit from the standard library-flavored concurrency interfaces emphasized by `unirun`. Each example indicates how a developer could rely on familiar primitives such as `concurrent.futures.Executor`, `asyncio`, or `multiprocessing` while layering in `unirun` ergonomics.
