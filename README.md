# unirun badge artifacts

This branch stores generated badge payloads produced by GitHub Actions.

- `badges/` contains JSON endpoints consumed by shields.io.
- Workflows force push updates here; avoid merging into `main`.
- Manual edits should happen via automation scripts to keep data consistent.
